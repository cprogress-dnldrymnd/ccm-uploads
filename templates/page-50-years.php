								It was in the late 1960s, when a young club motorcycle racer by the name of Alan Clews began making his mark in trials and scrambling events around the UK and across to the continent. In fact, on his first outing in France, he finished a more than respectable second riding a Rickman Metisse.

								This taste of success drove him towards acquiring better machinery. And the target? A works BSA scrambler, however the factory wouldn’t sell him one. Undeterred, he set about building a bike that would excel against BSA’s equipment. Alan made a pretty good job of it too, so much so, that he never had a chance to ride that bike as his club colleagues beat a path to his garage to snap up that first bike. And the next…. That year was 1971 and Clews Competition Machines was born!

								It was ironic then that Alan’s ascent coincided with the demise of Birmingham’s BSA brand and, with Alan’s improving fortunes, he was poised to take advantage of the remaining stock of their engines and tools. Alan stayed with 4-stroke power as other manufacturers turned to 2-stroke race engines which led to the bikes being referred to as “The Rolling Thunder!” and CCM went on to compete at the highest level in Motocross, Trials, road racing, Flat Track, also enjoying two successful Dakar campaigns. And in 1976, with legendary British stuntman, Eddie Kidd, at the controls, CCM could claim a world bus-jumping record too!

								CCM has proved to be an industry leader in the motorcycle world with the world's first aluminium trials bike in the ‘80’s, the first direct link suspension, the first carbon fibre road racers, the world's first aluminium bonded motorcycle chassis on its GP450 Adventure bike and so on – all proven on the race track over the years.
							</p>
							<p>
								All these developments provided a wealth of technical know-how that has been channelled into our products over the years. In the late '90s, CCM’s products were becoming more road biased each year, with “niche” products that would become leaders in their respective sectors. Utilising the superlight bonded chassis which was based on their successful MX race bike design, CCM opted to use a 450cc single that developed just 40hp rather than the ubiquitous 800-1200cc powerplants of the mainstream brands! This endowed the new GP450 Adventure with the ability to go where other road bikes feared to tread. The GP450 was chosen by adventurers tackling the Trans-America Trail, following the Dakar, and for circumnavigations of the globe and, as news of this featherweight bike travelled, it began to find a new audience with petite females, riders short of leg, and ageing bikers wishing to continue well into their dotage.

								Sadly, new Euro IV emissions regulations introduced in 2017 saw the demise of the feisty BMW 450 single but not before a daring band of brothers chose to take six standard GP450s on a record-breaking unsupported attempt to ride from the southern tip of South America, to the most northerly point in North America, tackling the perilous Darién Gap, a toxic jungle teeming with deadly snakes and insects, where lawless gangs ply their trade. They were forced to leapfrog “The Gap” and 77 Days and 28,000 miles later, the team arrived in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska proving their metal and the ability of the diminutive GP450.

								CCM’s military connections go back much further than this and many of our customers will have fond memories of learning to ride on the MT500, the ubiquitous workhorse of the British forces throughout the 80s and 90s. CCM still maintain a number of military contracts sending motorcycles and quad bikes into some of the more challenging areas of the world and flying the union flag. The demise of the GP450 led to a design which would take CCM on a totally new direction and attract a new audience. That design became known as the Spitfire and gave birth to an acclaimed series of Café Racers, Flat Trackers, Scramblers and Bobbers.

								50 years on and the founder’s eldest son, Austin is now at the helm, ably supported by youngest brother Russell and sons Ben, Jack and Billy. How many British motorcycle marques can boast that bloodline? Sadly, Alan passed away in 2018 just short of his 80th birthday, however he was able to rejoice in the renaissance of this great British biking brand, as he bore witness to the birth of the Spitfire and its offspring.

								Starring as the vehicle of choice in the biggest movie franchise of all, <strong>Marvel’s new Black Widow</strong> movie sees <strong>Scarlett Johanssen</strong> on board a CCM Scrambler that gave rise to the <strong>Blackout</strong> bike. Delayed until July 2021, the movie didn’t disappoint moviegoers with its fabulous mix of dramatic action and humour. 
							</p>
							<p>
								The second blockbuster, <strong>Infinite</strong>, is a new big-budget action-adventure starring Mark Wahlberg where the CCM plays a real starring role in a chase scene to rival the very best. Released in the States on <strong>Paramount+</strong>, this movie has been slated for release in September 2021 in Europe and we cannot wait to see the CCM show what it can really do on the big screen.
